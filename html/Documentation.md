This is a C++ application on which you can practise Mechanics. In our application, you can find exercises, explanations and other interesting things. It is developed following the study plan made by the Ministry of education for 9th grade in Physics. 

### Where is it available?
Our collaborative work took place in GitHub and for the files to be accessible to everyone they were uploaded in the GitHub Repository of our project. 

### Communication?
Communication is realized through Teams. Thanks to all the features and the provided visualization - on-screen communication and feedback are sufficiently complete.

### What technologies are used?
The technologies we used are C++ as the programming language with which the code is written, Git and GitHub for collaborative work, Visual Studio 2019 - as an IDE, Teams - connection and communication and Doxygen - preparing a presentation and documentation.
